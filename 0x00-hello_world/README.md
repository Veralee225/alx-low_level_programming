# 0x00-hello_world.

I'm learning about the introductory aspect of C.

The processes to execute a file; Starting from the preprocessor, to the compiler, assembler and finally the linker where the .exe file is produced.

In this project we were asked to do the following:

### 0-processor: Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor.

### 1-compiler: Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link it.
